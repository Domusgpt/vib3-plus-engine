# VIB3+ Engine

VIB3+ Engine is a WebGL-based visualization tool that combines 5-layer holographic rendering with 4D polytopal mathematics and 100 geometric variations. It provides a highly customizable and interactive experience for generating complex and beautiful geometric patterns.

## Features

*   **5-Layer Holographic Rendering:** Creates a sense of depth and complexity.
*   **4D Polytopal Mathematics:** Explores geometries beyond our three-dimensional world.
*   **100 Geometric Variations:** A vast library of shapes and patterns to explore.
*   **Interactive Controls:** Manipulate the visualizations in real-time.
*   **Audio Reactivity:** Visualizations can react to audio input.
*   **Export Options:** Save your creations as JSON, CSS, HTML, or PNG.

## Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VIB3-PLUS/VIB3-Engine.git

    cd VIB3-Engine
    ```
3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage

The user interface is divided into several panels:

*   **Controls:** Adjust parameters like rotation, density, chaos, and speed.
*   **Geometry:** Select from a wide range of geometric variations.
*   **Variations:** Browse and apply different pre-configured variations.
*   **Gallery:** View and manage your saved creations.
*   **Export:** Export your creations in various formats.
